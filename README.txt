In this file you should include:

Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why? 
* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.

There were two features that we did not include: One of them was converting private albums to public that was supposed to be the last feature we implemented but we decided eventually not to do it as we wanted to include better functionality on already existing features and ui/ux design choices such as hiding buttons/features for permissions. 

Another feature that needed more work was implementing a delete button for user photos. As of right now, I believe the album owner can delete anyone's photos but normal users cannot delete their own photos in public albums.
